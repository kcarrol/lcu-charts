# Introduction to LCU-Charts
LCU-Charts is a Angular Charting and Graphing Library based on and influenced by [Ngx-charts](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts).

This library began as a 'Fork' of Ngx-charts in order to extend features in the library to use in Fathym's Low Code Framework. LCU-Charts was then built into a Low Code Unit (LCU), following the best practices and architecture of Fathym. This LCU is open source, and can be installed as a dependency in any Angular project.

Start by checking out our [Simple Line Chart](charts/simple-line-chart), as well as browsing the rest of the LCU-Charts library.
